2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">API (Application Programming Interface):</span> A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. TPMs often define and manage APIs for their products or platforms.

3. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architecture (System Architecture):</span> The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution. TPMs influence and understand this deeply.

4. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Authentication:</span> The process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or application before granting access. TPMs design and manage robust authentication mechanisms.

5. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Baseline:</span> Is the approved version of the project’s scope, schedule, or budget used as a reference point. It helps measure actual progress against planned performance. Any deviation from the baseline may require change control to ensure the project stays aligned with its original objectives.

6. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Backend (Server Side): </span>The part of a software system that is not directly accessible by the user, handling data storage, business logic, and communication with databases and other services. TPMs often specialize in backend products.
